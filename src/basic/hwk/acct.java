//        * 1. When opening account, customer must enter userID (Minimum 3 characters long,
//        *    It cannot be one that which is already taken from userIDs list);
//        * 2. User must select password which must follow following:
//        *    A. Minimum 8 character long
//        *    B. Alpha Numeric
//        *    c. Must not contain username
//        * 3. Once account is created and initial balance is set, user should be able to withdraw
//        *    Money from their account: (Note: They cannot withdraw more than what they have in the account
//        *    For Example: If the balance is $300, they should not be allowed to withdraw anything greater than $300)
//        * 4. Set Account creation date
//        * 5. User should be able to delete an account
